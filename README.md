# Final Test OO-Design-2024

This is a set of exercises to test object-oriented design notions. The included exercises where extracted from [Head First Design Patterns Book](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajitpal/BookBank/master/%5BO%60Reilly.%20Head%20First%5D%20-%20Head%20First%20Design%20Patterns%20-%20%5BFreeman%5D.pdf) and they are based on the usage of different design patterns to make them with a flexible design and easy to maintain in case of future requirement changes.

For each exercise there is a main program or a test suite or both, that can be used to test the implementation.

> Note: Each of these exersises includes an UML diagram to simplify the visualization of the code on the `diagram` folder inside each project.
